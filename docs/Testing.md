# Testing

Testing the API could be done by using an API client software like (example: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)) or by installing a web browser extension.

Some examples of browser extensions:  

* [Talend API Tester](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/restlet-client-rest-api-t/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm  ) (Google Chrome)  
* [RESTClient](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient/) (Mozilla Firefox)
